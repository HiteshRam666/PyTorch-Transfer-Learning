## What is Transfer Learning ?
Transfer learning is a machine learning technique that uses knowledge learned from one task to improve performance on a related task. For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could be applied when trying to recognize trucks.

### Transfer learning can be useful when: 
- The second task is similar to the first task
- There is limited data available for the second task
- Training deep neural networks with less data compared to having to create a model from scratch
- Most real-world problems typically do not have millions of labeled data points to train such complex models

## Model Used in this project

EfficientNet is a type of neural network architecture that uses compound scaling to improve performance. It aims to improve performance while increasing computational efficiency by reducing the number of parameters and FLOPs (Floating point Operations Per Second).
